# User Guide: Large Screen Mode

## What is Large Screen Mode?

Large Screen Mode is a feature that makes the app easier to view on big screens when you're using a mobile device. When you connect your phone or tablet to a TV, projector, or monitor, the normal mobile layout can appear too small. Large Screen Mode scales up all the text, buttons, and cards so everyone can see clearly.

## When Should I Use It?

Use Large Screen Mode when:
- 📺 Presenting tournament results on a TV or projector
- 💻 Connecting your phone to a monitor via USB-to-HDMI
- 📱 Screen mirroring to a larger display
- 👥 Showing standings to a group of people
- 🎮 Using your device with a larger external display

## How to Use Large Screen Mode

### Activating Large Screen Mode

1. Open the tournament app on any of these screens:
   - **Leaderboard** (standings screen)
   - **Round Display** (lane view with matches)
   - **Tournament Completion** (final results)

2. Look for the icon in the top-right corner of the screen:
   - 📱 **Phone icon** = Currently in Mobile Mode
   - 🖥️ **Desktop icon** = Currently in Desktop Mode

3. Tap the icon to switch modes:
   - Tapping 📱 switches to Desktop Mode (larger layout)
   - Tapping 🖥️ switches back to Mobile Mode (normal layout)

## Tips and Best Practices

### 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Before Connecting**: Switch to Desktop Mode BEFORE connecting to the big screen
2. **Test First**: Try both modes to see which looks better on your display
3. **Keep Consistent**: Once you find your preferred mode, the app remembers it
4. **Portrait vs Landscape**: Desktop Mode works in both orientations

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Multiple Displays**: The setting applies to all screens in the app
2. **Quick Toggle**: You can switch modes anytime without losing data
3. **Presentations**: Start in Desktop Mode for tournaments with spectators
4. **Personal Use**: Stay in Mobile Mode for handheld tournament management

### ⚠️ Things to Know

1. **Not Automatic**: The app won't automatically switch modes when you connect to a big screen - you need to tap the icon
2. **Persists**: Your choice is saved, so you might need to switch back to Mobile Mode after disconnecting
3. **All Screens**: The mode affects all main screens (Leaderboard, Round Display, Completion)
4. **No Effect on Setup**: The setup screen (player/court registration) isn't affected by this setting

## Troubleshooting

### The text is still too small on my TV

1. Make sure you've tapped the desktop icon (should show 🖥️ when active)
2. Check your TV's display settings - some TVs have zoom/picture size options
3. Try both portrait and landscape orientations
4. Consider your viewing distance - Desktop Mode is optimized for 2-3 meters viewing distance

### The text is too large on my phone

1. Tap the 📱 phone icon to switch back to Mobile Mode
2. The app remembers your last choice, so it will stay in Mobile Mode next time

### The layout looks weird

1. Try rotating your device (portrait/landscape)
2. Toggle between modes to find which looks better
3. Desktop Mode is designed for screens 24" and larger - smaller screens may look crowded

### The toggle doesn't appear

The toggle button is available on:
- ✅ Leaderboard Screen
- ✅ Round Display Screen  
- ✅ Tournament Completion Screen

It's NOT available on:
- ❌ Setup Screen (player/court registration)
- ❌ Loading screens
